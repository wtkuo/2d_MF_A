# Mutual Information between conduction electron and impurity electron in 2d Mean Field Single Impurity Anderson Model   
This code is to calculate the MI between c-electron and f-electron in 2d Mean Field single impurity Anderson model. 

I put my Anderson model square lattice. 

My EE calculation is based on the local correlation functions to construct the reduced density matrix. Therefore, there are three main codes.

One is to construct Hamiltonian and full correlation function. 

Second one is to calculate the entanglement entropy given correlation function. 

Third one is to choose the region for us to calculate the mutual information.
